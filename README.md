## Data for testing

If you really want to realize all features, just test it on real data that can be grabbed from official [Kawasaki site](https://www.kawasaki.com/category/motorcycle) with help of [JsoupParser](https://github.com/bilichenCOM/jsoup-parser).
These items really take the cake. Enjoy it!
